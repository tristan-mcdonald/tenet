/*
this mixin is intended to be used on the :root element.
it sets a base font-size which is based on the viewport
width, and which scales between two font-sizes we've set, at two
viewport widths that we've also set. We then use CSS custom properties
to set REM unit values for individual type elements, based on three
different typographic scales. We set these as mixins, for easier
overriding of an element's font-size in the rest of the codebase.
